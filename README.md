# The Great Hunt

In march 2020, students from Aalborg Techcollege (https://techcollege.dk/) and students from IES El RincÃ³n (http://www.ieselrincon.es) develop together an App in Gran Canaria.

The Great Hunt was developed by a group of 4 students as a module project. 

Here you can find a draft deploy of the project (mobile PWA only):
https://thegreathunt-23ec5.web.app

### Prerequisites

* Visual Studio Code.

* Leaflet (or alternatively Google maps).
* Firebase Real Time Database.
* Firebase Hosting.

* [ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.com/) - agile project management within GitHub.
* [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro) - Ionic Framework is an open source UI toolkit for building performant, high-quality mobile and desktop apps using web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).
* [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) - an open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps.
* [Firebase Realtime Database](https://console.firebase.google.com/) - Store and sync data with a NoSQL cloud database.

## Getting Started

Install a full ionic develop environment.

* Download or clone this project repo.

```
git clone https://github.com/KuroiJP/the-great-hunt.git
```

* Install the dependencies and launch the App locally (inside the project directory):

```
npm install
ionic serve -l
```

***IMPORTANT: Virtual Reality and PWA functionality are not going to work unless you deploy the project in a https server. Follow next sections to get all that done.***

***IMPORTANT: By default the data is hardcoded in api.service.ts. If you want to keep your data in the a firebase realtime database just follow next sections to get it done.***

***Google API KEY no longer needed by default: Now Leaflet is used instead of Google maps for the maps and Geolocation. If you still want to use Google Maps you need to add a Google maps API key.***

## Remarkable points regarding PWA with Ionic 4 and uploading to firebase

As stated in the example in https://ionicthemes.com/tutorials/about/the-complete-guide-to-progressive-web-apps-with-ionic4:

1. Install @angular/pwa package:

```
ng add @angular/pwa
```

2. Build the app:

```
ionic build --prod
```

3. Create a project in firebase and after that deploy your ionic built project to it:

```
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

Initilize your firebase project answering the questions the following way:

```
firebase init
? Are you ready to proceed? Yes
? Which Firebase CLI features do you want to set up for this folder? Press Space to select features, then Enter to confirm your choices.
 ( ) Database: Deploy Firebase Realtime Database Rules
 ( ) Firestore: Deploy rules and create indexes for Firestore
 ( ) Functions: Configure and deploy Cloud Functions
>(*) Hosting: Configure and deploy Firebase Hosting sites
 ( ) Storage: Deploy Cloud Storage security rules
 ( ) Emulators: Set up local emulators for Firebase features
 ? What do you want to use as your public directory? www
 ? Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)? (y/N) n
 ? File docs/index.html already exists. Overwrite? (y/N) n
```

And now deploy your proyect:

```
firebase deploy
```

The execution of the above command returns the Hosting URL that you can try in your favorite mobile browser. (It's only ready for the mobile resolution right now)

## Remarkable points regarding Firebase Realtime Database configuration

By default this draft project is using hardcoded data. If you want to use Firebase Realtime Database, then follow next steps:

1. Create a Firebase Realtime Database in your firebase project. Follow the instructions in this link:

https://morioh.com/p/208e6d5d903a


2. Don't forget to copy firebase configuration data in the following files:

```
environments/environments.ts
environments/environments.prod.ts
```

3. Don't forget to Uncomment the following line in app.module.ts:

```
AngularFireModule.initializeApp(environment.firebase),
```

4. Edit the method getZones() in the file api.service.ts uncommenting the lines to get data from your firebase realtime database of your firebase project.

5. Re-initialize your firebase project and select the option for the use of database:

```
firebase init
? Are you ready to proceed? Yes
? Which Firebase CLI features do you want to set up for this folder? Press Space to select features, then Enter to confirm your choices.
 (*) Database: Deploy Firebase Realtime Database Rules
 ( ) Firestore: Deploy rules and create indexes for Firestore
 ( ) Functions: Configure and deploy Cloud Functions
>(*) Hosting: Configure and deploy Firebase Hosting sites
 ( ) Storage: Deploy Cloud Storage security rules
 ( ) Emulators: Set up local emulators for Firebase features
 ? What do you want to use as your public directory? www
 ? Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)? (y/N) n
 ? File docs/index.html already exists. Overwrite? (y/N) n
```

6. And now deploy your proyect again:

```
firebase deploy
```

7. Finally. Don't forget to use the following database rules. In database.rules.json should be to allow everyone "read" permission of your firebase realtime database:

```
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": true,
    ".write": "auth != null"
  }
}
```

## Remarkable points regarding Google maps

Now this draft project is using Leaflet as default option for the maps and the geolocation. With this library you don't have to create any API Key.

If for any reason you prefer using Google maps, you have to put your Google Maps API Key in all places marked with (PUT YOUR GoogleMaps API Key HERE). Here is the list of files:

```
src/environments/environment.prod.ts
src/environments/environment.ts
package.json
config.xml
```

If you use Google Maps don't use "ionic build --prod" to build project. Instead use the following line:

```
npm run buildwww
```

Re-initialize your firebase project and select the option for the use of database:

```
firebase init
? Are you ready to proceed? Yes
? Which Firebase CLI features do you want to set up for this folder? Press Space to select features, then Enter to confirm your choices.
 (*) Database: Deploy Firebase Realtime Database Rules
 ( ) Firestore: Deploy rules and create indexes for Firestore
 ( ) Functions: Configure and deploy Cloud Functions
>(*) Hosting: Configure and deploy Firebase Hosting sites
 ( ) Storage: Deploy Cloud Storage security rules
 ( ) Emulators: Set up local emulators for Firebase features
 ? What do you want to use as your public directory? docs
 ? Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)? (y/N) n
 ? File docs/index.html already exists. Overwrite? (y/N) n
```

And finally deploy your proyect:

```
firebase deploy
```

***IMPORTANT: In package.json put your API Key only in (PUT YOUR GoogleMaps API Key HERE) and not in (YOUR_API_KEY_IS_HERE)***
